# devraphe Portfolio

##Description
This portfolio is a simple app that contains webviews to my external links and url launcher to be able to dial my number and to send me an email.
It supports two languages, English and french and English being the default language.

It also allow the user to select which theme mode they would prefer.

This UI design is an idea of mine, I started doing a bit of UI design myself.

I used libraries such as url_launcher which is used to redirect users to the factory applications such as call app and email app. A major library I used here was Stacked, which is a booster for the mvvm archietectural pattern used in this project, Stacked uses the provider state management solution to manage state and also provides a clean way I can declare my routes and Inject my services. here is a link to see more. www.filledstacks.com.

## Things I would Improve
I would probably use shared_preferences to save the users prefered thememode and locale to the device.

I didn't face any challenges implementing any feature.
